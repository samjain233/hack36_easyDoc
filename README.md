  This is Project EasyDoc made at Hack36 . In this project we had automate the process of taking appointment from doctor and the patient can see in how much time his/her appointment can be made with doctor of his choice . Patient can also see their previous records by the doctor 
  Doctor also get ease of attending patient as after using this there is no need of receptionist for the user registeration , users simply can register with their mobile and can get exact time after which their turn likely to come 
  So it is beneficial for both doctor and patient as well
